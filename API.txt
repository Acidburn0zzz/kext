Of the 40 FUSE methods in FUSE API version 7.12, the following methods are
currently not supported at all on OSXFUSE:

FUSE_GETLK	We use VFS-provided file locking instead.
FUSE_SETLK	We use VFS-provided file locking instead.
FUSE_BMAP	TBD (fuse_vnop_blockmap -> one or more calls to FUSE_BMAP).
FUSE_POLL	poll(2) is based on kqueue.
